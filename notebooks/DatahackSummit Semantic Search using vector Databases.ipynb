    " \n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a modern approach that can be used to enhance natural language search capabilities. It combines the best of retrieval-based and generative methods in NLP to answer questions or search queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simplified explanation of how this might work:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Understanding:** Similar to traditional natural language search, the first step in RAG is understanding the user's query, which can involve Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech tagging (POS tagging), and other techniques to parse and interpret the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Retrieval:** RAG first retrieves a subset of documents from a larger corpus that are most relevant to the user's query. This retrieval step is based on a similarity measure, such as cosine similarity in the case of vectorized representations of text. The result is a shortlist of documents that are likely to contain the answer to the user's query.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Answer Generation:** Once the relevant documents are retrieved, a separate generative model takes the user's query and the retrieved documents as input and generates a response. The generative model can be a sequence-to-sequence model like a Transformer, which is trained to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text.\n",

    "RAG is a potent approach for natural language search, particularly for tasks that require understanding and generating language based on a large corpus of text, such as question answering or dialog systems.

    "## Transforming Text In a Way Condusive for search\n",

    "Many Machine Learning algorithms and almost all Deep Learning Architectures are not capable of processing strings or plain text in their raw form. In a broad sense, they require numerical numbers as inputs to perform any sort of task, such as classification, regression, clustering, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transforming text into vectors, known as vectorization, is a critical part of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This process allows us to convert human language into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand and work with. Here are a few common methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bag of Words (BoW)**: This approach treats each document as an unordered bag or \"multiset\" of its words, disregarding grammar and word order but keeping the frequency of each word.\n",
    "\n",
    "![bow](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:661/1*3K9GIOVLNu0cRvQap_KaRg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)**: This method reflects how important a word is to a document in a collection or corpus. It's often used as a weighting factor in text mining and information retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "![tfidf](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GTmNOZ5DkSorxEoATI93xvrBDCCOn0XAGDav8ybPJ0hIkqlk4nimcY9P8SNleZV1Cf8vnGVAlwawdZ5Fe8kPykKRZbHVUixjSPu1BJdd9DoAdgAVr5VMwhK2oSkXpyDFXunuON-l)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Embeddings**: These are dense vector representations in which similar words have similar vectors in the vector space. Word2Vec and GloVe are two popular methods of creating word embeddings. Word embeddings capture more nuanced semantic meanings and relationships between words compared to BoW and TF-IDF.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Word2Vec\n",
    "1) Word2Vec does not consider the order of words (e.g., \"cat chases dog\" and \"dog chases cat\" are treated the same).\n",
    "2) Word2Vec generates a single vector representation for each word, regardless of the context (e.g., \"bank\" as a river bank and \"bank\" as a financial institution are treated the same).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transitioning into Transformers\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, researchers developed new techniques and models that could understand context better.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contextual Word Embeddings (ELMo, etc.)**: ELMo (Embeddings from Language Models) assigns embeddings to words based on their context, addressing the polysemy issue present in Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Transformers**: The Transformer model, introduced in the paper \"Attention is All You Need,\" revolutionized NLP. It's based on the idea of self-attention, allowing the model to weigh and understand the impact of each word on others in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The transformer model architecture underlies models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer). Unlike Word2Vec, these models provide context-aware representations by considering words in their specific context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**BERT** uses bidirectional training of Transformers, meaning it looks at the context from both left and right sides (words before and after the target word).\n",
    "\n",
    "**GPT** uses a transformer decoder and is trained in a unidirectional manner. It has been used extensively for tasks that require the generation of text.\n",
    "\n",

    "Vector databases, also known as vector search engines or similarity search engines, play a crucial role in managing and leveraging high-dimensional vector data produced by Machine Learning (ML) models, including the Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP tasks. Here's how they can be helpful:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Efficient Similarity Search**: Vector databases are designed to enable fast and efficient similarity search in high-dimensional vector spaces. They can help find the vectors that are most similar to a given vector, which is a common requirement in NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalable Storage and Retrieval**: Vector databases provide a scalable solution for storing and retrieving large amounts of high-dimensional vector data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Integration with ML Workflows**: Vector databases can be easily integrated into ML workflows. They can serve as a bridge between the offline training of models and the online serving of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use Cases in NLP**: In the context of NLP and language models, vector databases can be used to store and retrieve word or sentence embeddings. They can be used in tasks like semantic search (finding documents with similar meanings), recommendation systems (finding similar items or content), and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Real-time Applications**: With their ability to provide quick similarity search results, vector databases can support real-time applications such as chatbots, personalized recommendations, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, vector databases help to store, manage, and retrieve the high-dimensional vector data produced by models like transformers, thus enabling the effective application of these models in various NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![vectordb](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/vr8gru94/production/e88ebbacb848b09e477d11eedf4209d10ea4ac0a-1399x537.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use a vector database\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a vector database as opposed to a simple file for storing and retrieving vector data becomes essential in various situations. Here are some scenarios when you would want to opt for a vector database:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Large-scale Data**: If you're dealing with large-scale vector data, simply reading from and writing to files can be inefficient. A vector database is designed to handle such large amounts of data efficiently and quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Efficient Searching**: If you need to perform similarity search queries on the vector data, a vector database provides sophisticated indexing mechanisms to allow efficient nearest-neighbor search, which would be highly inefficient with plain files.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concurrency and Real-time Access**: If you need concurrent access to your vector data or if your application requires real-time data access, a vector database is a better fit as it supports these requirements out of the box. File-based systems, on the other hand, may struggle with concurrent accesses and real-time data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Persistence and Reliability**: If you need your data to be reliably stored and persist across sessions or if you want built-in backup and restore capabilities, a vector database is a much safer bet than simple file storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Scalability and Distributed Computing**: Vector databases are built to work in distributed computing environments and can easily scale up or down based on the needs of your application. This is not typically possible with file-based storage without significant manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if your use case involves small-scale data, infrequent access, or does not require efficient search capabilities, a simple file-based storage might suffice. The choice between a vector database and a file really depends on the specifics of your use case and the scale and complexity of your data.\n",

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications.\n",
    "BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\n",

We discuss cutting-edge methods and architectures such as BERT, GPT, ELMo, ULMFit among others. Classically, tasks in natural language processing have been performed through rule-based and statistical methodologies. However, owing to the vast nature of natural languages these methods do not generalise well and failed to learn the nuances of language. Thus machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes and decision trees coupled with traditional models such as Bag-of-Words and N-grams were used to usurp this problem. Eventually, with the advent of advanced recurrent neural network architectures such as the LSTM, we were able to achieve state-of-the-art performance in several natural language processing tasks such as text classification and machine translation. We talk about how Transfer Learning has brought about the well-known ImageNet moment for NLP. Several advanced architectures such as the Transformer and its variants have allowed practitioners to leverage knowledge gained from unrelated task to drastically fasten convergence and provide better performance on the target task. This survey represents an effort at providing a succinct yet complete understanding of the recent advances in natural language processing using deep learning in with a special focus on detailing transfer learning and its potential advantages.\n",

The Transformer architecture on which BERT is based places hierarchical global attention on the concatenation of the context and query. Our additions to the BERT architecture augment this attention with a more focused context to query (C2Q) and query to context (Q2C) attention via a set of modified Transformer encoder units. In addition, we explore adding convolution-based feature extraction within the coattention architecture to add localized information to self-attention. We found that coattention significantly improves the no answer F1 by 4 points in the base and 1 point in the large architecture. After adding skip connections the no answer F1 improved further without causing an additional loss in has answer F1. The addition of localized feature extraction added to attention produced an overall dev F1 of 77.03 in the base architecture. We applied our findings to the large BERT model which contains twice as many layers and further used our own augmented version of the SQUAD 2.0 dataset created by back translation, which we have named SQUAD 2.Q. Finally, we performed hyperparameter tuning and ensembled our best models for a final F1/EM of 82.317/79.442 (Attention on Steroids, PCE Test Leaderboard).\n",
